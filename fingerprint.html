	HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) serves to encrypt and send data back and forth in a secure form impossible to break. This can be a problem to companies, schools, and even the FBI, and so HTTPS Proxy Appliances are used to bypass the security. How is this done, you ask? Its achieved by taking advantage of the fact that <q>Web browsers trust the identity assertion made by a remote website when that site presents a certification of its identity that has been signed by a higher authority that the browser already trusts</q>(1). They can simply adding their own certification to their computers that results in all websites trusting them and sending them all information put into websites on said device.
	<br /><br />While its impossible to prevent, you can detect when an authorization is spying on your websites. This is possible because although websites can add their own private key and make it identical, the public key has to be different, so we can use this flaw to test to see if a connection is being intercepted. Simply compare a remote servers real certificate fingerprint with the SSL Interceptions fingerprint and check to see any differences. If the fingerprints are vastly different, then your connection IS being traced and information stolen. If they are the same, then youre safe.
